# Locational Choices
Models associated with the article: Blanchard, Simon J., Tatiana Dyachenko, Keri L. Kettle (2020). "Locational Choices: Modeling Consumer Preferences for Proximity to Others at Reserved-Seating Venues." <i>Journal of Marketing Research</i>.

## Code

In the folder <strong>PS</strong>, we provide the R codes of our Bayesian statistical model for the analysis of locational choice data. 

In the folder <strong>CNN_Benchmarks</strong>, we provide a naive implementation of covolutional neural networks (trained with adam) on the same data. The code was developed by <A HREF="https://www.gerad.ca/en/people/theo-moins">Theo Moins</A>. 

## Datasets

The datasets were collected via <A HREF="http://www.seatmaplab.com" target="_blank">Seatmaplab.com</A>. 

For each set of analysis, we used a training (<b>in-sample</b>) and a <b>holdout</b> file. The characteristics of each dataset are described in more detail in Web Appendix A. Datasets can be downloaded <A HREF="https://seatmaplab.com/public/locationalchoicedatasets/">here</A>.

## Usage

### PS (Bayesian Choice Models)

### CNN_Benchmarks

For the CNN implementation, we provide a Jupyter notebook. It requires Torch, numpy, csv, and pyplot.
